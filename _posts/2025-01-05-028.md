I read this text to get a glimpse of plantation life in the West Indies. Many of the features in this context were similar to the characteristics in Colonial Sumatra in the 19th century. Sheridan suggests that the rise of plantation economy in Barbados, one of the important islands that became key producers of sugar, was followed by several changes, including: 1. The transformation of subsistence farming to labor- and capital-intensive plantations; 2. Dependence upon foodstuff, building materials, goods, and services from outside sources; 3. Shift in labor force from white indentured servants to chattel slaves from Africa; 4. The rise of a wealthy planter governing oligarchy with close ties with the metropolis; 5. Emergence of sugar colonies as major geopolitical forces in the Atlantic world.
